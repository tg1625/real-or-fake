# Real or Fake

This p5.js project is a game-show-style game called Real or Fake created for NYU's Creative Coding Course. In this game, you compete against a Teachable Machine to determine if an image is of a real person, or one procedurally generated by ThisPersonDoesNotExist. You have 30 seconds to click the button, and say either "real" or "fake" for each question. However, you must say your answer before the machine, which might buzz in ahead of you. If either player answers correctly, they will gain one point. If they answer incorrectly, the game will just move on to the next question. Get the most points in 5 rounds to win the game!

### Description

The final project for NYU's  Creative Coding course was an open brief, in which we could expand on anything we had learned throughout the course. For this brief, I really wanted to continue working with the Teachable Machine from the last project. I also wanted to explore something I hadn't tried yet in this course - making a game.  Lastly, I've always been really interested in "deep fakes", and how computers are getting so good at creating fake things that at first glance, look very very real. 

This game ended up being way more difficult to create than I anticipated, and there were some things I had to leave out or cut down on (i.e. graphic design, intro scene, etc). Regardless, I'm proud of the core functionality of this game, and I'm just happy it works!
